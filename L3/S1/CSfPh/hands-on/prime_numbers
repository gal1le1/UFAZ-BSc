Hands-on - Prime numbers
Write an algorithm that displays a list of the prime numbers between 1 and 100

Several solutions may exist. The following is the one you suggested this morning

FOR k FROM 2 TO 100
   FOR j FROM 2 TO k-1
      isPrime = True
      IF (k%j==0)
         isPrime = False
   IF isPrime
      DISPLAY k

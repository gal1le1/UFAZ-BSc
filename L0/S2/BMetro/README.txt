BMetro v1.0 

The program is extremely simple. 
You just need to execute BMetro.exe, select starting and destination stations by just clicking on them, choose time at which you will travel and then click on Calculate. 
To calculate time needed for another trip click on the Reset button.

Now you have one less excuse to be late :)

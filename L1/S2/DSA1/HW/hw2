function that returns pointer to the array(array, size, empty_index) (empty_index as a pointer)

main()

	pointer to table
	
	allocate dynamically an array of <size> elements (test whether the allocation is done correctly) 
	empty_index = size (The variable which allows us to know the first empty place starting from the beginning)  	

	initialize your array with some numbers to be able to delete some values(but 0 values are not allowed, since they will be considered as the empty places)
	
	while true
	   print "Do you want to delete the last element?"
	   get answer from the user
	
	   if yes:
		call function delete_value
		print the whole table
	   if no:
	       	printf "Process of deleting finished"
	        exit
	   else: continue;

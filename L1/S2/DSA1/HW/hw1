#define SIZE 5
Dynamically allocate an array of SIZE integers (original array)
declare empty_index=0 (The new number will be put in this place)
while True
   print "Do u want to enter a new value?"
   
   if yes
      get a new value
      if empty_index is less than SIZE (which means we have free place)   
         put new value in (empty_index)th place of your array
         increment empty_index (because now the next place will be free)
      else (means we don't have free place)
         create a new temporary array of size SIZE
         copy all numbers of your original array to this temporary array
         increment SIZE by 5
         dynamically allocate a new array (actaully ur original array) with new size (SIZE+5)
         copy all numbers of temporary array to new created original array (of size SIZE+5)
         delete temporary array
         put new value in (empty_index)th place of your array
         increment empty_index (because now the next place will be free)
